Todo list:

(BASIC START)

-On click event listener needed for when clicking burger menu

-Burger menu open and drop down menu with height + width.

-Burger menu drop down menu needs links for navigation buttons

-On hover when burger menu pressed

(BASIC END)

-Use getelementbyid to select the burger menu

variables needed:

--need to store the getelementbyid burger menu in a variable, this will be what is adjusted.

--maybe variable for the drop down menu, i plan to just put the text and html in it.

--drop down menu will be made in javascript not HTML.



That should be it for now, and I'll see how things go.
