let burgerMenu = document.getElementById();
let dropDownMenu = document.getElementById();




/*
Todo list:

(BASIC START)

-On click event listener needed for when clicking burger menu

-Burger menu open and drop down menu with height + width.

-Burger menu drop down menu needs links for navigation buttons

-On hover when burger menu pressed

(BASIC END)

-Use getelementbyid to select the burger menu

Variables needed:

--need to store the getelementbyid burger menu in a variable, this will be what is adjusted.

--maybe variable for the drop down menu, i plan to just put the text and html in it.

--drop down menu will be made in javascript not HTML.

Functions needed:

---Dropdown menu function on click, drops rectangle with specified dimensions and links on that, perhaps making a div somehow.

---May try and nest the navigation bar into itself, and make the menu appear on click, a lazy method of doing a burger menu

---Once the above idea is created, then I may try and experiment with making it more proper.

That should be it for now, and I'll see how things go.

Maybe replace the inner.html text of the nav bar letters with an Open Menu button that switches between the two instead, somehow find a way to add an image
- although having it in words makes it easier to know what it is
