Work in progress portfolio with a lot of things taken and remade from my old one: https://matthewrichardson120.wixsite.com/portfolio


I might try and make a carosel that you press to see each section instead of scrolling down, but I don't know if I can do it. (I will watch a tutorial)

on qualifcations section, can try and make the blue bar do that ship with night and sun animation on wix website.

Want to try and do most things with HTML and CSS unless I really have to us JavaScript.

But I might not do some things, because if I can't click/press something on a mobile device
