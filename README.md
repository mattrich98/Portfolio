Work in progress portfolio with a lot of things taken and remade from my old one: https://matthewrichardson120.wixsite.com/portfolio


I might try and make a carosel that you press to see each section instead of scrolling down, but I don't know if I can do it. (I will watch a tutorial)

on qualifcations section, can try and make the blue bar do that ship with night and sun animation on wix website.

when a section is clicked, it will be greyed out like when you hover over it in navigation bar.

Want to try and do most things with HTML and CSS unless I really have to us JavaScript.
